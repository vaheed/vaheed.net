# 🌀 Static HTML Version of My WordPress Site

This repository contains a **static HTML version** of my original WordPress site, converted for fast, lightweight hosting via **GitHub Pages**.

## 🌐 Live Site


## 🚀 What’s Inside

- `index.html` – Homepage
- `/assets/`, `/css/`, `/js/` – Supporting files and resources
- All content is static (no PHP or database)

## 🛠️ How to Update

1. Replace or edit files locally
2. Push changes to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update content"
   git push
   ```

## 📦 Hosting via GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is enabled from the **`main` branch, root folder**.

To check or re-enable it:
- Go to **Settings > Pages**
- Set source to: `main` and `/ (root)`
- Your site will be published automatically!
